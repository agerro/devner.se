# Just a start

## The who
I'm starting this blog just to share my thought on both my professional and leissure time as a DevOps Engineer.
I work at Cybercom Group Sweden in the town of Gothenburg, and has since the start of february 2017.
During my working days, I spend most time learning and testing out new thing, especially in AWS.

## The why
The purpose of the website was mainly to have some to have as an end goal learn about AWS CodeDeploy, CodePipeline and CodeBuild. And following that, learning about CloudFront and how to manage AWS CDN solution. I felt that it was just easier to have something to work with when learning those thing. The second reason was that I wanted a place to share my knowledge, learning and experiences that I have in my "career" as an engineer.

PS. The image is the second hobby that I have. I'm regularly dj:ing at different parties/wedding/frat parties and clubs. (I'm the one on the left, the guy to the right is my collegue Jocke).
